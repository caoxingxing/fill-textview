Android Filling TextView

This is an implementation of an Android TextView component that automatically sets the font size of its content so that the content fills the available space. The implementation was
inspired / based on the contents if this thread: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2617266/how-to-adjust-text-font-size-to-fit-textview . Currently FillTextView will consider both the X
and Y axis to determine the font size. The project contains a demo Activity.
